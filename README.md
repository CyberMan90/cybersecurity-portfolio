# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio by Deon Coles

Welcome to my cybersecurity project portfolio. Each project simulates real-world analyst tasks across blue team domains like network traffic analysis, log analysis, threat detection, and cloud auditing. Built hands-on to demonstrate both technical skill and security mindset.
