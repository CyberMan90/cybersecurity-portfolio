# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio by Deon Coles

Welcome to my cybersecurity project portfolio. Each project simulates real-world blue team tasks across domains like threat detection, network traffic analysis, log correlation, and cloud auditing. These hands-on builds highlight both technical skills and security mindset.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. 🧪 Splunk Brute Force Attack Detection  
Detects brute-force login attempts using simulated logs and Splunk SPL.

✅ Generated realistic login logs via Python (success/failure patterns)  
✅ Detected brute-force IPs using SPL (MITRE ATT&CK T1110: Brute Force)  
✅ Built dashboards (login trends, top failed usernames, IPs)  
✅ Created alerting logic with thresholds, severity, and scheduling

### 2. 🕵️ Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)  
Captured and analyzed packet data across TCP, DNS, HTTP, and ICMP protocols.

✅ Applied protocol filters to isolate normal vs. suspicious traffic  
✅ Observed TCP 3-way handshakes, DNS resolution, and ICMP echo behavior  
✅ Annotated screenshots showing packet headers and session details

### 3. ☁️ AWS Cloud Audit: Config + IAM Review *(Coming Soon)*  
Using AWS CLI, Security Hub, and Config snapshots to assess security posture of cloud infrastructure.

✅ Cloud resource inventory  
✅ IAM privilege escalation check  
✅ CIS Benchmark references
