# ðŸ§ª Splunk Brute Force Detection Project

This project simulates brute-force login activity and demonstrates how to detect it using **Splunk**, custom log data, and SPL queries. Built to mimic a real SOC analyst workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Simulate and detect brute-force login attempts from multiple IPs using synthetic log data and custom Splunk searches. Visualize patterns and trigger alerts â€” just like in a real-world enterprise SOC.
